# These rules are intended to catch malware via the NetFlow protocol.  This
# requires that your system has "nfdump" tools install. In particular,  the 
# Quadrant modified "nfdump",  that allows the program "nfcapd" to receive
# decode and send to the Sagan FIFO Netflow data.  
# 
# For more information see:

# Example log string sent to the FIFO from the modified "nfcapd":
# source_ip: 10.10.0.1/80, destination_ip: 173.165.207.65/16464, protocol: UDP, duration: 5.400, flags: |.AP.SF|, tos: 0, packets: 312, bytes: 4222451716, last_time: 2013-11-30 01:10:24, vlan_src: 32767, vlan_dst: 0
