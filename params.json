{"name":"Sagan-rules","body":"Welcome to the \"Sagan Rules\" README file\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is the Git repository for the Sagan engine rule sets.  You \r\nprobably won't find these useful unless you're actually using Sagan!\r\nFor more information,  check out the Sagan main web site at:\r\n\r\nhttp://sagan.quadrantsec.com\r\n\r\nWhat is Sagan? \r\n--------------\r\n\r\nSagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log \r\nanalysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a \r\nmulti-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event \r\nanalysis. The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the \r\nSourcefire \"Snort\" IDS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain \r\ncompatibility with rule management software (oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc)\r\nand allows Sagan to correlate log events with your Snort IDS/IPS \r\nsystem. Since Sagan can write to Snort IDS/IPS databases via \r\nunified2/barnyard2 or direct SQL access, it is compatible with all \r\nSnort \"consoles\". For example, Sagan is compatible with Snorby \r\n[http://www.snorby.org], Sguil [http://sguil.sourceforge.net], BASE, \r\n and the Prelude IDS framework! (to name a few).\r\n\r\nSagan supports many different output formats,  log normalization \r\n(via liblognorm),  script execution on event and automatic firewall\r\nsupport via \"Snortsam\" (see http://www.snortsam.net).  \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit the Sagan web site: \r\nhttp://sagan.quadrantsec.com. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Rule sets for Sagan","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
